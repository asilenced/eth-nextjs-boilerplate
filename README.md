# Welcome!

Why is this boilerplate the best? Because all the top eth boilerplates on github right now are created by companies who integrate every aspect of their product/service into the boilerplate, making it all but unusable unless you sign up for their service!

Not this one.

This boilerplate uses the following open source libraries to bring you a fully functional, mobile optimized dApp:

- [next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [react.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [wagmi](https://wagmi-xyz.vercel.app/)
- [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)
- [chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/)
